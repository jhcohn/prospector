User Interaction
================

The primary user interaction is through the ``prospector.py`` script and a **parameter file**,
a python file in which several variables and functions must be defined.
Command line syntax calls the ``prospector.py`` script as an executable and is as follows for single thread execution:

.. code-block:: shell

		cd demo
		python prospector.py --param_file=demo_params.py

Additional command line options can be given (see below).
You can copy the ``prospector.py`` script to wherever you intend to run the code, or put it in your path.
The required variables and functions in ``demo_params.py`` are

1. ``run_params``: A dictionary.

   This dictionary specifies global options and parameters used for setting up and running the code.
	 It is passed as keywords to all the functions listed below.

2. ``model_params``: A list of dictionaries.

   Each element is a dictionary discribing an individiual model parameter,
   to be varied or kept constant during the fitting

3. ``load_obs``: A function.

   This function will take the ``run_params`` dictionary as keyword arguments
   and returns on obs dictionary (see Data_)

4. ``load_model``: A function


5. ``load_sps``: A function


See ``tests.sh`` and the parameter files and ``prospector.py script`` in the
“demo” directory of the repository for more examples of proper usage.

The ``run_params`` dictionary
----------------------------

The following parameters conrol key aspects of the operation of the code,
and are stored in a special dictionary called ``run_params``.
The ``run_params`` dictionary is passed as keyword arguments to the
``load_obs``, ``load_sps``, ``load_model``, and ``load_gp`` functions.
This means you can add to it if you want additional parameters to control the output of these functions.


General parameters:

``"verbose"``
    Boolean.
    If ``True`` lots of diagnostic information will be written to stdout during execution.

``"debug"``
    Boolean.  If ``True``, halt before starting minimization or sampling.
    Can be useful to debug inputs when used with an interactive python session.

``"outfile"``
    String.  Base name of the output files.
    Various extensions as well as a time stamp will be appened to this string.

emcee sampling parameters:

``"nwalkers"``
    Integer.  Number of emcee walkers.

``"nburn"``
    List of integers, e.g. ``[32, 64, 64]`` giving the number of iterations in each burn-in run.
    After each number of iterations the walkers will be trimmed and a new ball of
    samplers will be initialized around the highest-probability walker.
    This can help avoid stuck walkers and speed up burn-in.

``"niter"``
    Integer.  Number of iterations for the final production run.

``"initial_disp"``
    Float.  Default value to use for the dispersion in the parameter

``"interval"``
   A number between 0 and 1 giving the fractional interval at which to
   incrementally save the chain to disk.  This can be helpful if there is a
   possibility that your process might be killed but you don't want to lose all
   the hard-won sampling that has taken place so far.

optimization parameters:
    
``"do_powell"``
    Boolean.  If ``True``, do a round of Powell minimization before MCMC sampling.
    If MPI is enabled then ``np`` minimizations from different initial conditions will be run,
    and the highest likelihood result chosen as the center for the sampler ball.
		This can perform poorly if there are many very degenerate parameters.

``"ftol"``
    Float.  For the Powell minimization.

``"maxfev"``
    Integer.  For the Powell minimization.

Nested sampling parameters:

``"nestle_method"``
   One of ``"single"``, ``"multi"``, or ``"classic"``.  The method to use in
   nested sampling.

``"nestle_npoints"``
   The number of active points in the nested sampling algorithm, defaults to 200

``"nestle_npoints"``
   The number of active points in the nested sampling algorithm, defaults to 200

   
Data manipulation parameters:

``"logify_data"``
    optional Boolean.  Switch to do the fitting in log flux space.
    Not recommended, as it distorts your errors.

``"rescale_spectrum"``
    Boolean.  If ``True``, rescale the spectrum to have an average of 1 before doing anything.
    The scaling parameter is stored in the ``obs`` dict as ``obs["rescale"]``.
		This parameter should be ``False`` unless you are simultaneously fitting photometry
		(see ``normalize_spectrum`` below),
		or you are fitting for the spectral calibration as well.

``"normalize_spectrum"``
    optional Boolean.
    If ``True`` make an initial guess of the relative normalization of the spectrum and the photometry,
    using synthetic photometry of the spectrum through the filter specified ``"norm_band_name"``.
    The normalization guess is stored in the obs dictionary (as ``normalization_guess``).

``"norm_band_name"``
    String.  Name of the filter to use for making an  initial guess at the spectral normalization.

Source Basis Parameters:

``"zcontinuous"``
    Integer.  If fitting galaxy spectra using py-FSPS, this is passed to the StellarPopulation
    object on instantiation and controls how metallicity interpolation is done.
    See the python-FSPS documentation for details.

``"libname"``
   String.  If fitting stellar spectra, this is the name of the HDF5 file containing the stellar spectral grid.


There is limited support for command line overrides of the ``run_params`` dictionary values.
For example

.. code-block:: shell

		python prospector.py --param_file=demo_params.py --nwalkers=128

will cause the code to use 128 walkers regardless of the value given directly in the ``run_params`` dictionary.
Such overriden parameters must be present as keys in the ``run_params`` dictionary,
as they will be coerced to have the same data type as the default value in the ``run_params`` dictionary.
Currently only scalars can be changed at the command line.
